# Bitcoin Tribe - Issues Fixed

## Summary of Issues Resolved

This document summarizes the critical issues that were identified and fixed in the Bitcoin Tribe React Native project.

## 1. **React Native Dependencies & Setup**
- ✅ **Fixed:** Dependencies were properly installed and configured
- ✅ **Fixed:** Installed CocoaPods for iOS development (was missing)
- ✅ **Fixed:** Completed setup script execution successfully

## 2. **React Hooks Dependency Issues (Critical)**
These were causing potential runtime bugs and infinite re-render loops:

### Fixed in `src/screens/settings/Settings.tsx`:
- ✅ **Fixed:** Wrapped `enableBiometrics` function in `useCallback` with proper dependencies
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added missing `enableBiometrics` dependency to useEffect
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added missing `navigation` and `onBoarding.invalidPin` dependencies to useEffect
- ✅ **Fixed:** Removed unused `key` variable

### Fixed in `src/screens/splash/Splash.tsx`:
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added missing `mutate` and `pinMethod` dependencies to useEffect
- ✅ **Fixed:** Removed unnecessary `mutate` dependency from useCallback
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added missing `onInit`, `setAppType`, and `setIsWalletOnline` dependencies to useEffect

### Fixed in `src/screens/wallet/WalletDetails.tsx`:
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added proper dependencies to useEffect hooks to prevent stale closures
- ✅ **Fixed:** Fixed complex dependency arrays that could cause infinite re-renders
- ✅ **Fixed:** Removed unused imports and variables
- ✅ **Fixed:** Removed unused `getStyles` function

## 3. **Code Quality Issues**
- ✅ **Fixed:** Syntax error in `src/services/electrum/net.js` - added missing curly braces after if statement
- ✅ **Fixed:** Removed unused variables and imports that were cluttering the codebase

## 4. **Development Environment**
- ✅ **Fixed:** Ruby and CocoaPods installation for iOS development
- ✅ **Fixed:** Project dependencies properly installed with yarn

## Issues Remaining
The project still has ~767 linting issues that need attention:
- **505 errors** and **262 warnings** remain
- Most are unused variables, missing dependencies, and code style issues
- These should be addressed in future iterations to improve code quality

## Critical Issues Resolved
The most critical issues have been resolved:
1. ✅ React hooks dependency problems that could cause runtime bugs
2. ✅ Missing iOS development dependencies (CocoaPods)
3. ✅ Syntax errors that would prevent compilation
4. ✅ Setup and build environment properly configured

## Next Steps
1. Address remaining linting issues gradually
2. Add missing peer dependencies warnings
3. Review and fix React component performance issues
4. Consider adding stricter TypeScript configuration

The project is now in a much more stable state and can be built and run without critical runtime issues.
